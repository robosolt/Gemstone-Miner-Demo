NOTES:
- many ints should be unsigned, but this has proven to be unpractical since the SDL library uses ints in stead of
	unsigned ints in many places, and the code would become littered with casts to avoid compiler errors/warnings
- the program uses a timer to signal the right time to render; this could also be done by testing in the event-loop
	but this may cause timing to interfere with event processing or vice versa (too much time rendering may not
	leave enough time for event processing - for good responsiveness, it should be preferred to drop frames instead)

TO DO:
- keep score and put it on the display
