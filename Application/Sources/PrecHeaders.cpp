#include "PrecHeaders.h"

// compile this file to re-create the precompiled headers from PrecHeader.h

// Note: Precompiled headers not only speed up compiling; it also provides
// additional advantages in Visual Studio, as it helps IntelliSense with
// otherwise undetectable include structures, and thus avoids the
// wriggly lines indicating supposed errors in the IDE.
