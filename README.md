# Gemstone-Miner-Demo

This is a demo project I did once for a job application, written in a few days.
I did not know SDL (Simple DirectMedia Layer) before starting this project, but it served well.
This project is not meant to be a complete game, just a way to show my coding skills.

How to play:
- click two adjacent gems to swap them out
- 3 equal gems in a row will disappear
- try to destroy as many gems as you can before the time runs out

Have fun!
